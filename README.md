# Digit-Recognition-using-the-MNIST-Dataset
A convolutional neural network model was constructed to predict handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset was used to train and validate the model.

This is the classic first project when building convolutional neural network models. The dataset is a collection of handwritten images of numbers from 0 to 9. The goal of the project is to create a model that can predict the correct written digit.

The project is located in the .ipynb notebook file and the library requirements are located in requirements.txt.

The dataset can be accessed at the following website: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
